# COVID-19
I've analyzed the data and predicted the number of cases, deaths and recoveries for the nest 21 days worldwide based on the time series 
data developed by John Hopkins CSSE. Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL).
The data has 3 csv file of the total number of confirmed cases, total deaths, total recoveries from 22nd January 2020 to 23rd March 2020.
I've preprocessed the data, showed some trends and predicted using Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression models.
